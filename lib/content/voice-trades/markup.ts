export const tradesFaqs: { q: string; a: string; cat: keyof typeof tradesFaqTopics }[] = [
  { cat: "customers", q: "Will callers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask, and the agent takes a message or puts them through, depending on your plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Which trades do you set it up for?",
    a: "Our AI receptionist for trades covers electricians, carpenters and joiners, cleaning companies, roofers and landscapers, plus plumbers, heating engineers and builders, who each have their own page. We also set it up for most other trades that win work over the phone." },
  { cat: "urgent", q: "Does it give technical or safety advice?",
    a: "No. It never diagnoses a fault or tells a caller how to fix something. It only reads out safety steps you have approved, word for word, and sends urgent calls to a person." },
  { cat: "urgent", q: "What happens with an urgent call?",
    a: "The agent asks the questions you set, then puts the call through to whoever is on call on Growth and Scale, or texts it to you straight away on Starter. If a caller describes a fire or a danger to life, it tells them to ring 999." },
  { cat: "prices", q: "Will it tell callers our prices?",
    a: "Only the prices you give us, worded the way you want: call-out charges, day rates or from-prices. If a price depends on seeing the job, it says so and books a quote visit." },
  { cat: "prices", q: "Can it book quote visits and site visits?",
    a: "Yes. It books into your diary using the areas you cover, your working hours and the travel time you set, so visits don't clash." },
  { cat: "prices", q: "Can customers send photos of the job?",
    a: "Yes. The agent can text the caller a link to send photos, and they arrive with the call summary so you can price or prepare before you visit." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Does it work with our job management software?",
    a: "On Growth and Scale the agent writes each job into your job management software. What connects depends on the software you use, and we confirm it on the discovery call." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "Both. You can divert your existing business line to the agent, or we can set up a new number with your local area code." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your prices, booking rules, on-call route and diary access." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our office staff?",
    a: "No. Most trades businesses use it to catch the calls nobody can answer: on the tools, on the road and after hours. If you have office staff, it takes the overflow and passes them calls with the details already written down." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI receptionist for trades cost?",
    a: "From £249 a month plus VAT on Starter, with a £795 one-off setup fee. Growth is £449 a month and Scale is £849 a month. Minutes past your allowance cost 60p each." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "No. Every plan is billed monthly with 30 days' notice." },

      <h2>What is an AI receptionist <span class="hl">for trades?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI receptionist for trades is software that answers your business phone in natural, spoken conversation when you can't. It finds out what the caller needs (a quote, a repair, a booking or something urgent), answers from the prices and details you approve, books visits into your diary and passes urgent calls to whoever is on call. You get a summary of every call by text or email.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">On Starter it does exactly that job. On Growth and Scale it works as a full AI voice agent: it puts callers through to you live, calls new enquiries back and follows up quotes. Either way, OMH writes the script, connects your diary and runs it for you. See our <a href="/ai-voice-agents/receptionist" class="font-semibold text-band-ink underline decoration-gold decoration-2 underline-offset-4">AI receptionist plan</a>, or how our <a href="/ai-voice-agents" class="font-semibold text-band-ink underline decoration-gold decoration-2 underline-offset-4">AI voice agent</a> works across UK businesses.</p>
