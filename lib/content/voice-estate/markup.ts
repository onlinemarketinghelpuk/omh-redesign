export const estateFaqs: { q: string; a: string; cat: keyof typeof estateFaqTopics }[] = [
  { cat: "callers", q: "What is an AI receptionist for estate agents?",
    a: "It's software that answers your branch phone in natural conversation, books viewings and valuations, qualifies buyers and tenants and passes the rest to your team. Our Starter plan is the AI receptionist. Growth and Scale add live transfers, enquiry call-backs and multi-branch routing. OMH builds, tests and manages it for you, so there's nothing for you to set up yourself." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Will callers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Callers deserve to know, and anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask." },
  { cat: "viewings", q: "Can it book viewings into our diary?",
    a: "Yes. It checks real availability, follows your viewing rules, such as notice needed and accompanied viewings, and books the slot while the buyer is on the line." },
  { cat: "viewings", q: "Can it book valuations?",
    a: "Yes. Homeowners and landlords who ring about selling or letting are booked straight in with a valuer, with the property type, timescale and anything else your team wants to know before they arrive." },
  { cat: "viewings", q: "Does it qualify buyers and tenants?",
    a: "It asks the questions you set, such as position, mortgage in principle, move date or pets, and records the answers. It never gives mortgage or financial advice." },
  { cat: "viewings", q: "Can it discuss or accept offers?",
    a: "No. It never discusses, accepts or agrees offers, prices or terms, and never shares other buyers' details. It takes the details and puts the caller through to your negotiator, or books an urgent call back." },
  { cat: "viewings", q: "What happens with tenant emergencies out of hours?",
    a: "It follows the route you set. Urgent problems such as leaks or no heating go to your on-call property manager or approved contractor, and every report is logged for the morning." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Can the agent put a caller through to a negotiator?",
    a: "Yes, on the Growth and Scale plans. You set the rules: offers, progression calls, tenant emergencies and anyone who asks for a person can be put through to the right phone. Outside your hours, and on the Starter plan, the agent takes a detailed message and sends it to your team." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "What happens when the agent doesn't know the answer?",
    a: "It says so. The agent answers only from information you have approved, so when a question falls outside that, it offers to take a message or transfer the call. We review those moments and add the answers worth adding." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Does it work with our property software?",
    a: "It works with most diaries and property software. We check yours on the first call and tell you plainly what connects directly and what needs a workaround." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "You can keep your number and divert calls to the agent, either all of them or only the ones your team misses. If you want a local number for a new branch, we can set one up." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your listings, viewing rules and diary access. If your branches are more complex than usual, we give you a realistic timeline after the discovery call, before you commit to anything." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Is client data kept safe?",
    a: "You remain the data controller and OMH acts as your processor under a written data processing agreement, in line with UK GDPR. We agree what is stored, where and for how long before go-live." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Are calls recorded?",
    a: "Only if you want them to be. Callers are told at the start of the call, and recordings are deleted on the schedule you set." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Can it call buyers and tenants back?",
    a: "Only people who have given appropriate consent, such as buyers who asked for viewing feedback or a call back. We follow the UK PECR rules, screen lists against the Telephone Preference Service where required and act on opt-outs straight away. We don't run cold calling campaigns." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our negotiators?",
    a: "No. It takes the overflow and the routine calls, so your team can focus on viewings, valuations and closing sales. You choose when it answers: only when the lines are busy, only out of hours, or first on every call." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI voice agent for estate agents cost?",
    a: "Our managed AI voice agent for estate agents starts at £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale, for several branches, is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "Plans are billed monthly with 30 days' notice. We set out the terms in writing before you start, including what's included each month and what counts as extra. Every invoice shows your included minutes and any overage." },

      <h2>What is an AI voice agent <span class="hl">for estate agents?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI voice agent is software that answers and makes phone calls for your agency in natural, spoken conversation. It works out whether the caller is a buyer, a seller, a tenant or a landlord, answers from listing details and fees you have approved, books viewings and valuations into your diary and passes anything it can't handle to a negotiator, with a summary of the call. You may also see it called an AI voice agent for real estate, or a real estate AI receptionist. It's the same thing, set up here for UK estate and letting agents.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">Callers don't press buttons or leave voicemails. They say what they need, and the agent responds the way a well-trained branch receptionist would: a property AI receptionist that knows your listings, fees and viewing rules. The difference with OMH is that we set it up and run it for you: we write the script around your real calls, connect your diary and property software, such as Reapit, Alto or Jupix, and keep improving it.</p>
