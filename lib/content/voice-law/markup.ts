export const lawFaqs: { q: string; a: string; cat: keyof typeof lawFaqTopics }[] = [
  { cat: "callers", q: "Will callers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Callers deserve to know, and anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask." },
  { cat: "advice", q: "Does it give legal advice?",
    a: "No. The agent never gives legal advice, never comments on the merits of a matter and never tells a caller whether they have a case. It takes the details, books a consultation or passes the call to the right fee earner." },
  { cat: "advice", q: "What happens with urgent matters, such as someone at a police station?",
    a: "It follows the rules your firm sets. In office hours, calls you mark as urgent, such as someone held at a police station or a client who needs an urgent injunction, are put straight through to the person or team you choose. Out of hours they go to your on-call solicitor or the number you choose. Every urgent call is flagged at the top of the morning summary." },
  { cat: "advice", q: "Can it take the details for a conflict check?",
    a: "Yes. It takes the names your firm needs before a conflict check, such as the caller and the other parties, and passes them to your team. It never decides whether the firm can act and never judges the matter. Your team runs the check." },
  { cat: "advice", q: "Can it give conveyancing quotes?",
    a: "Only from the fee scales your firm approves. It can give your standard legal fee for a sale or purchase at a given price and list the disbursements you tell it to. Anything outside your scales goes to your team for a written quote." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Can it sort new enquiries by practice area?",
    a: "Yes. It asks what the matter is about and sorts it by the areas you cover, such as conveyancing, family, wills and probate, employment, personal injury or commercial. On Growth and Scale it can put the call through to that team. Otherwise it takes a detailed message and sends it to them." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Can existing clients reach their fee earner?",
    a: "Yes. On Growth and Scale it puts them through to their fee earner or team by your rules. When the fee earner is in court or a meeting, it takes a message with the matter reference and the reason for the call. It doesn't give updates on a matter itself." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "How does it handle upset callers, for example after a death or a separation?",
    a: "It speaks calmly, takes its time and repeats details when asked. It keeps to the practical steps: taking details and booking a meeting. Anyone who wants a person is put through in office hours, or a message is taken for a call back." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "What happens when the agent doesn't know the answer?",
    a: "It says so. The agent answers only from information you have approved, so when a question falls outside that, it offers to take a message or transfer the call. We review those moments and add the answers worth adding." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Does it work with our case management software?",
    a: "It works with most diaries. We look at your case management system on the first call and tell you plainly what connects directly and what needs a workaround." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can it book consultations with the right fee earner?",
    a: "Yes. It books by fee earner, practice area and meeting type, such as a first consultation or a follow-up meeting, and keeps to the lengths and rules you set. Anything that needs a fee earner's say-so first goes to your team." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "You can keep your number and divert calls to the agent, either all of them or only the ones reception misses. If you want a local number for a new office, we can set one up." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your fee scales, routing rules and diary access. If your firm is more complex than usual, we give you a realistic timeline after the discovery call, before you commit to anything." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Is client information kept confidential?",
    a: "You remain the data controller and OMH acts as your processor under a written data processing agreement, in line with UK GDPR. We agree what is stored, where and for how long before go-live. The agent only asks for the details your script sets out." },
  { cat: "data", q: "We are regulated by the SRA. Who decides what the agent says?",
    a: "Your firm does. You approve the script, the routing rules and every answer the agent gives, and you can change them at any time. We build the agent to the rules you set and show you every change before it goes live." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Are calls recorded?",
    a: "Only if you want them to be. Callers are told at the start of the call, and recordings are deleted on the schedule you set." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Can it call clients about appointments and quotes?",
    a: "Only people who have agreed to it. We follow the UK PECR rules and act on opt-outs straight away; opt-outs are removed the same day. We don't run cold calling campaigns." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our receptionists?",
    a: "No. It takes the overflow and the routine calls, so your team can look after the clients in front of them. You choose when it answers: only when the lines are busy, only out of hours, or first on every call. Anything sensitive or complicated still goes to your team." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI receptionist for law firms cost?",
    a: "Our AI receptionist for law firms and solicitors (the Starter plan) is £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale, for firms with several offices or departments, is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "Plans are billed monthly with 30 days' notice. We set out the terms in writing before you start, including what's included each month and what counts as extra. Every invoice shows your included minutes and any overage." },

      <h2>What is an AI receptionist <span class="hl">for law firms?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI receptionist for law firms is software that answers and makes phone calls for your firm in natural, spoken conversation. Some firms call it a legal AI receptionist; we call it an AI voice agent, because on Growth and Scale it does more than answer the phone. It works out whether the caller is a new client, an existing client or someone with an urgent matter, answers from fee scales and information you have approved, books consultations into your diary and passes anything that needs a solicitor to your team, with a summary of the call.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">Callers don't press buttons or leave voicemails. They say what they need, and the agent responds the way a well-trained law firm receptionist would. The difference with OMH is that we set it up and run it for you: we write the script around your real calls, connect your diary and, where it allows, your case management software, and keep improving it. See our <a href="/ai-voice-agents/receptionist">AI receptionist plan</a> if you only need the phone answered.</p>
