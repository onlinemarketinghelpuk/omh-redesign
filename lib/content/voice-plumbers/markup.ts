export const plumbersFaqs: { q: string; a: string; cat: keyof typeof plumbersFaqTopics }[] = [
  { cat: "callers", q: "Will callers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Callers deserve to know, and anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask." },
  { cat: "safety", q: "What does it do with a burst pipe or a leak?",
    a: "It follows the route you set. It takes the address, what is happening and how to get in, then puts the call through to whoever is on call or sends them the details straight away. It gives only the safety steps you have approved, such as where to find the stopcock. Every emergency is flagged at the top of the summary." },
  { cat: "safety", q: "Does it diagnose faults or give repair advice?",
    a: "No. The agent never diagnoses a fault, guesses at the cause or tells callers how to fix anything. It gives only the safety steps you have approved, in your words, and passes everything else to your plumbers." },
  { cat: "safety", q: "What happens if a caller says they can smell gas?",
    a: "It gives the National Gas Emergency number, 0800 111 999, tells the caller to ring it now and ends the call there. It doesn't book a job or give any other advice. The call is flagged for your team." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Will it tell callers our callout charge and prices?",
    a: "Only as you word them. If you give us your callout charge, hourly rate or fixed prices, it says them exactly that way. If you would rather not quote on the phone, it says someone will confirm the price and books a visit. It never makes a price up." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Can it take jobs from landlords, letting agents and tenants?",
    a: "Yes. It asks who is calling and follows your rules for each: who to contact for access, any job reference, who pays and whether a landlord or agent has to approve the work first. All of it goes in the job summary." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Can the agent put a caller through to us?",
    a: "Yes, on the Growth and Scale plans. You set the rules: emergencies, complaints and anyone who asks for a person can be put through to the right phone, including whoever is on call. On the Starter plan, the agent takes a detailed message and it is emailed to you straight away." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "What happens when the agent doesn't know the answer?",
    a: "It says so. The agent answers only from information you have approved, so when a question falls outside that, it offers to take a message or transfer the call. We review those moments and add the answers worth adding." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can it book routine jobs and quote visits?",
    a: "Yes. It books into your diary by job type and length, such as a repair or a quote visit for a new bathroom, and keeps to the areas and time slots you set. Jobs that need a plumber to look first go to your team." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can callers send photos of the problem?",
    a: "Yes, if you want them to. The agent asks for photos and texts the caller where to send them. It also takes the full address, parking and access details, and puts it all in the job summary." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Does it work with our job management software?",
    a: "It works with most diaries and job management systems. We check yours on the first call and tell you plainly what connects directly and what needs a workaround." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "You can keep your number and divert calls to the agent, either all of them or only the ones you miss while you're on a job. If you want a local number for a new area, we can set one up." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your prices, booking rules, on-call route and diary access. If your business is more complex than usual, we give you a realistic timeline after the discovery call, before you commit to anything." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Is customer data kept safe?",
    a: "You remain the data controller and OMH acts as your processor under a written data processing agreement, in line with UK GDPR. We agree what is stored, where and for how long before go-live." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Are calls recorded?",
    a: "Only if you want them to be. Callers are told at the start of the call, and recordings are deleted on the schedule you set." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Can it call customers back about quotes?",
    a: "Only customers who have agreed to it. We follow the UK PECR rules and act on opt-outs straight away; opt-outs are removed the same day. We don't run cold calling campaigns." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our office staff?",
    a: "No. It takes the calls you miss while you're under a sink, driving between jobs or off for the night, so your team can get on with the work. You choose when it answers: only when you can't pick up, only out of hours, or first on every call. Anything awkward still goes to you." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI voice agent cost for a plumbing business?",
    a: "Our managed AI voice agent starts at £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale, for firms with several branches or teams, is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "Plans are billed monthly with 30 days' notice. We set out the terms in writing before you start, including what's included each month and what counts as extra. Every invoice shows your included minutes and any overage." },

      <h2>What is an AI voice agent <span class="hl">for plumbers?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI voice agent is software that answers and makes phone calls for your plumbing business in natural, spoken conversation. It works out whether the caller has an emergency, needs a repair or wants a quote, answers from prices and information you have approved, books jobs into your diary and sends emergencies to whoever is on call, with a summary of the call.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">Callers don't press buttons or leave voicemails. They say what they need, and the agent responds the way a well-trained office manager would. The difference with OMH is that we set it up and run it for you: we write the script around your real calls, connect your diary and job software, and keep improving it.</p>
