  { cat: "callers", q: "Will clients know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask, and the agent takes a message or puts them through, depending on your plan." },
  { cat: "bookings", q: "Which salons do you set it up for?",
    a: "Hair salons, nail salons, beauty salons and medspas, plus barbers, lash and brow bars, spas and tanning salons. If you run a hair salon, an AI receptionist books by stylist and service length, so it fits the way your diary already works." },
  { cat: "bookings", q: "Can it book the right stylist and the right length of appointment?",
    a: "Yes. We load which stylist or therapist does each service and how long each one takes, so it only offers slots that really fit." },
  { cat: "bookings", q: "Can it book patch tests?",
    a: "Yes, if your rules ask for one. It checks whether the client needs a patch test before a colour or lash appointment and books it first." },
  { cat: "bookings", q: "What happens when a client cancels?",
    a: "It cancels or moves the appointment by your rules and explains your cancellation policy as you word it. On Growth and Scale it can offer the freed-up slot to clients on your waitlist." },
  { cat: "bookings", q: "Does it take deposits or card payments?",
    a: "No. It explains your deposit and cancellation policy. Payments stay with your booking system or your team, and the agent never asks for card details." },
  { cat: "bookings", q: "Will it tell clients our prices?",
    a: "Only the prices you give us, worded the way you want. If a price depends on a consultation, it says so and books one." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Does it give skin or medical advice?",
    a: "No. Anything about a reaction, a skin condition or aftercare goes to your team. It only reads out information you have approved." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Does it work with our salon booking software?",
    a: "On Growth and Scale the agent writes each booking into your software, where it connects. What connects depends on the software you use, and we confirm it on the discovery call." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "Both. You can divert your existing salon line to the agent, or we can set up a new number with your local area code." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your service menu, prices, booking rules and diary access." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our front desk?",
    a: "No. Most salons use it to catch the calls nobody can answer: when every chair is full, at lunchtime and after closing. If you have a front desk, it takes the overflow and passes calls on with the details already written down." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Is client data kept safe?",
    a: "We agree what is stored, where and for how long before go-live, and handle client data in line with UK GDPR." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI receptionist for salons cost?",
    a: "Our AI receptionist for salons (the Starter plan) is £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale, for salon groups, is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "No. Every plan is billed monthly with 30 days' notice." },

      <h2>What is an AI receptionist <span class="hl">for salons?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI receptionist for salons is software that answers your salon phone in natural, spoken conversation when your team is busy with clients. Some owners call it an AI salon receptionist. It finds out what the caller wants, checks your booking diary, books the right service with the right stylist or therapist and sends a confirmation text. Anything it can't answer, it takes a proper message for the team.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">On Starter it does exactly that job. On Growth and Scale it works as a full AI voice agent: it puts callers through to the salon when someone is free, calls back missed callers and runs several salons on one service. Either way, OMH writes the script, connects your booking software and runs it for you. See our <a href="/ai-voice-agents/receptionist">AI receptionist plan</a>, or how our <a href="/ai-voice-agents">AI voice agent</a> works across UK businesses.</p>
