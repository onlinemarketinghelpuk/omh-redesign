export const voiceFaqs: { q: string; a: string; cat: keyof typeof faqTopics }[] = [
  { cat: "callers", q: "What is the difference between an AI voice agent and an AI receptionist?",
    a: "The two terms overlap, and many people use them for the same thing. An AI receptionist usually means an agent that answers inbound calls, takes messages and books appointments. An AI voice agent can do that and more, such as calling new web leads back, following up quotes and routing calls between departments. Our Starter plan works as an AI receptionist, and Growth and Scale add the wider voice agent features." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI voice agent cost in the UK?",
    a: "Our managed AI voice agent starts at £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan. DIY tools can cost less, but you build and maintain them yourself." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Is it legal to use an AI voice agent in the UK?",
    a: "Yes, when it's set up properly. Calls that involve personal data come under UK GDPR, and outbound calls must follow PECR, including Telephone Preference Service checks where they apply. Our agents tell every caller they're speaking to an AI, say when calls are recorded and only make outbound calls to people who have given consent." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Will callers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. We set every agent up to say it's an AI assistant at the start of the call. Callers deserve to know, and it avoids awkward moments later in the conversation." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Can the agent transfer a call to a real person?",
    a: "Yes, on the Growth and Scale plans. You set the rules: emergencies, existing clients, complaints and anyone who asks for a person can be put through to the right phone. Outside your opening hours, and on the Starter plan, the agent takes a detailed message and sends it to your team." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "What happens when the agent doesn't know the answer?",
    a: "It says so. The agent answers only from information you have approved, so when a question falls outside that, it offers to take a message or transfer the call. We review those moments and add the answers worth adding." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Which calendars and systems does it work with?",
    a: "The agent needs somewhere to put bookings and call notes, usually your calendar and your CRM or practice system. We check your exact tools during discovery and tell you plainly what connects directly, what needs a workaround and what isn't possible yet." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can we keep our existing phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "In most cases you keep your number and divert calls to the agent, either all of them or only the ones your team can't answer. If you want a new local number, such as an 0161 number for Manchester, we can arrange one as part of setup." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Are calls recorded, and how does that fit with UK GDPR?",
    a: "Calls can be recorded and transcribed so you can review them, and callers are told at the start of the call. You remain the data controller and OMH acts as your processor under a written agreement. We agree retention periods with you and delete recordings on that schedule." },
  { cat: "data", q: "What are the rules for outbound calls?",
    a: "The agent only calls people who have given appropriate consent, such as customers who asked for a reminder or a call back. We follow the UK PECR rules, screen lists against the Telephone Preference Service where required and act on opt-outs straight away. We don't run cold calling campaigns to bought or non-consented lists." },
  { cat: "sectors", q: "Is it suitable for dental clinics and healthcare providers?",
    a: "Yes, for bookings, routing and practical questions such as opening hours, fees and directions. The agent never gives clinical or medical advice. Anything clinical goes to your team, and urgent calls follow the emergency route you set." },
  { cat: "sectors", q: "Is it suitable for law firms?",
    a: "Yes, for taking new enquiries, booking consultations and routing existing clients. The agent never gives legal advice and doesn't comment on the merits of a matter. It collects the details and gets the caller to the right person." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your content and diary access. If your calls are more complex than usual, we give you a realistic timeline after the discovery call, before you commit to anything." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "Plans are billed monthly with 30 days' notice. We set out the terms in writing before you start, including what's included each month and what counts as extra. There are no hidden usage fees, and every invoice shows your included minutes and any overage." },
  { cat: "working", q: "We're not in one of your six cities. Can we still work with you?",
    a: "Yes. We're based in Hullbridge, Essex and work with businesses across the UK remotely. London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Bristol are where we focus our voice agent work at the moment." },

      <h2>What is an <span class="hl">AI voice agent?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI voice agent is software that answers and makes phone calls for your business in natural, spoken conversation. It understands what the caller wants, answers from information you have approved, books appointments into your calendar and passes anything it can't handle to a person on your team, with a summary of the call.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">Callers don't press buttons or leave voicemails. They say what they need, and the agent responds the way a well-trained receptionist would. The difference with OMH is that we set it up and run it for you: we write the script around your real calls, connect your diary and systems, and keep improving it.</p>
