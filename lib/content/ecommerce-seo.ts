  /ecommerce-seo-services. Copy is verbatim from the client's brief
  "OMH-Ecommerce-SEO-Services-Page" (Oct 2026): focus keyword "ecommerce seo services",
  co-primary "ecommerce seo agency". The brief's keyword counts depend on this wording,
  so edit the brief first, then this file.

  Developer notes carried over from the brief:
  - Package prices are pending; they are confirmed in the written proposal. Put the
    figures in `packages[].price` once the client sets them.
  - The meta description mentions a free ecommerce SEO audit. If that offer stops,
    swap it for "Book a free consultation".
  - Hero stats and the results section come from /case-studies/clothing-business.
