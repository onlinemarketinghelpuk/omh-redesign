  { cat: "callers", q: "Will callers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask, and the agent takes a message or puts them through, depending on your plan." },
  { cat: "callers", q: "Does it give financial, tax or mortgage advice?",
    a: "No. It never gives advice or recommends a product. It answers only from information you have approved and passes anything that needs advice to a qualified person." },
  { cat: "clients", q: "Which firms do you set it up for?",
    a: "Accountants and bookkeepers, financial advisers, mortgage brokers and insurance brokers, plus tax advisers, payroll bureaus and wealth managers. Solicitors have their own page." },
  { cat: "clients", q: "Can it put clients through to their own accountant or adviser?",
    a: "Yes, on Growth and Scale. You set the rules, and the agent passes the caller across with everything they said. If that person is busy, it takes a full message." },
  { cat: "clients", q: "Can it cope with the January self-assessment rush?",
    a: "Yes. It answers several calls at once, so no client hears an engaged tone, and it books follow-ups into the diaries you choose." },
  { cat: "clients", q: "Can it chase clients for documents?",
    a: "Yes, on Growth and Scale. It calls existing clients about the records you are waiting for, using wording you approve, and logs each call." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Does it work with our practice software?",
    a: "It works with most diaries. What else connects depends on the software you use, and we confirm it on the discovery call." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Are calls recorded?",
    a: "Only if you want them to be. If your firm needs calls recorded and kept, we agree the setup with your compliance team before go-live, and callers are told at the start of the call." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Is client data kept safe?",
    a: "You remain the data controller and OMH acts as your processor under a written data processing agreement, in line with UK GDPR. We agree what is stored, where and for how long before go-live." },
  { cat: "systems", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "Both. You can divert your existing line to the agent, or we can set up a new number with your local area code." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your services, fees, approved wording and diary access." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our receptionist?",
    a: "No. Most firms use it to catch the calls nobody can answer: in meetings, at lunch, after hours and in January. If you have a receptionist, it takes the overflow and passes calls on with the details already written down." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI receptionist for accountants cost?",
    a: "Our AI receptionist for accountants (the Starter plan) is £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale, for firms with several offices, is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "No. Every plan is billed monthly with 30 days' notice." },

      <h2>What is an AI receptionist <span class="hl">for accountants?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI receptionist for accountants is software that answers your firm's phone in natural, spoken conversation when your team is busy. It works out whether the caller is a new enquiry, an existing client or someone chasing a deadline, answers from fees and information you have approved, books meetings into the right diary and passes anything that needs an accountant or adviser to your team, with a summary of the call.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">On Starter it does exactly that job. On Growth and Scale it works as a full AI voice agent: it puts callers through to their own accountant or adviser, calls back new enquiries and chases clients for the documents you're waiting on. Either way, OMH writes the script, connects your diary and runs it for you. See our <a href="/ai-voice-agents/receptionist">AI receptionist plan</a>, or how our <a href="/ai-voice-agents">AI voice agent</a> works across UK businesses.</p>
