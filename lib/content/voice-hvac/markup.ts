export const hvacFaqs: { q: string; a: string; cat: keyof typeof hvacFaqTopics }[] = [
  { cat: "customers", q: "Will customers know they are talking to an AI?",
    a: "Yes. Every agent says it is an AI assistant at the start of the call. Customers deserve to know, and anyone who would rather speak to a person can ask." },
  { cat: "safety", q: "Does it diagnose faults or give gas safety advice?",
    a: "No. The agent never diagnoses a fault, suggests a fix or tells anyone an appliance is safe to use. It takes the make, model and any fault code on the display, books an engineer by your rules and passes anything technical to your team." },
  { cat: "safety", q: "What happens if a caller says they can smell gas?",
    a: "The agent tells them to call the National Gas Emergency Service on 0800 111 999 straight away. It gives no other gas safety advice. The call is flagged for your team at once and sits at the top of the summary." },
  // 22 Oct review, still open in the 26 Oct keyword brief: carbon monoxide gets the same route as a smell of gas.
  { cat: "safety", q: "What happens if a caller thinks there is carbon monoxide?",
    a: "The same as a smell of gas. The agent tells them to call the National Gas Emergency Service on 0800 111 999 straight away, and to call 999 if anyone feels unwell. It gives no other safety advice. The call is flagged for your team at once and sits at the top of the summary." },
  { cat: "safety", q: "How does it handle breakdowns with no heating or hot water?",
    a: "It follows the priority rules you set. It takes the make, model and fault code, asks whether anyone in the home is elderly, unwell or very young if you want it to, and books into the slots you hold back for breakdowns. Every breakdown is flagged in the summary." },
  { cat: "customers", q: "Can it book landlord gas safety certificates?",
    a: "Yes. Landlords and letting agents can book several properties on one call. The agent takes each address, the tenant's contact details for access and the date the current certificate runs out, then books CP12 visits into the slots you set." },
  { cat: "customers", q: "Does it work for service plan and warranty customers?",
    a: "Yes. It notes plan and warranty numbers, answers from the plan details you approve and books plan customers into the slots you set for them. Questions about what a manufacturer's warranty covers go to your team." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can it book quotes for new boilers, heat pumps and air conditioning?",
    a: "Yes. It takes the property type, the current system and what the customer wants, then books a survey visit with the right engineer. It never quotes a price you haven't approved." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How does it cope with the winter rush?",
    a: "It answers every line at once, so nobody hears an engaged tone when the first cold snap hits. It books by your priority rules, breakdowns first, and gives you a list of every caller and what was booked." },
  { cat: "customers", q: "Can the agent put a caller through to the office or an engineer?",
    a: "Yes, on the Growth and Scale plans. You set the rules: urgent breakdowns, complaints, technical questions and anyone who asks for a person can be put through to the right phone, including your on-call engineer out of hours. On the Starter plan, the agent takes a detailed message and sends it to your team." },
  { cat: "customers", q: "What happens when the agent doesn't know the answer?",
    a: "It says so. The agent answers only from information you have approved, so when a question falls outside that, it offers to take a message or transfer the call. We review those moments and add the answers worth adding." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Does it work with our job management software?",
    a: "It works with most diaries and job management systems. We check yours on the first call and tell you plainly what connects directly and what needs a workaround." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "Can we keep our phone number, or get a local one?",
    a: "You can keep your number and divert calls to the agent, either all of them or only the ones the office misses. If you want a local number for a new area you cover, we can set one up." },
  { cat: "setup", q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Starter goes live in 3 working days, Growth in 5 to 7 and Scale in 12 to 15. The clock starts once we have your price list, service areas, booking rules and diary access. If your firm is more complex than usual, we give you a realistic timeline after the discovery call, before you commit to anything." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Is customer data kept safe?",
    a: "You remain the data controller and OMH acts as your processor under a written data processing agreement, in line with UK GDPR. We agree what is stored, where and for how long before go-live." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Are calls recorded?",
    a: "Only if you want them to be. Customers are told at the start of the call, and recordings are deleted on the schedule you set." },
  { cat: "data", q: "Can it call customers when a service or certificate is due?",
    a: "Only customers who have agreed to reminders. We follow the UK PECR rules and act on opt-outs straight away; opt-outs are removed the same day. We don't run cold calling campaigns." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Will it replace our office staff?",
    a: "No. It takes the overflow and the routine calls, so your team can look after the jobs in front of them. You choose when it answers: only when the lines are busy, only out of hours, or first on every call. Anything technical, sensitive or complicated still goes to your team." },
  { cat: "working", q: "How much does an AI receptionist for HVAC services cost?",
    a: "Our AI receptionist for HVAC services and heating engineers (the Starter plan) is £249 a month plus VAT with 300 minutes included, and a one-off setup fee from £795. Growth is £449 a month and Scale, for firms with several depots or teams, is £849 a month. Extra minutes cost 60p each on every plan." },
  { cat: "working", q: "Is there a minimum contract?",
    a: "Plans are billed monthly with 30 days' notice. We set out the terms in writing before you start, including what's included each month and what counts as extra. Every invoice shows your included minutes and any overage." },

      <h2>What is an AI receptionist <span class="hl">for HVAC services and heating engineers?</span></h2>
      <p class="mt-5 text-band-muted">An AI receptionist for HVAC services is software that answers and makes phone calls for your heating firm in natural, spoken conversation. Some firms call it an HVAC AI receptionist; we call it an AI voice agent, because on Growth and Scale it does more than answer the phone. It works out whether the caller has a breakdown, needs a service or a gas safety certificate, or wants a quote, answers from prices and information you have approved, books visits into your diary and passes anything technical to your team, with a summary of the call.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">Callers don't press buttons or leave voicemails. They say what they need, and the agent responds the way a well-trained office manager would. The difference with OMH is that we set it up and run it for you: we write the script around your real calls, connect your diary and job software, and keep improving it. See our <a href="/ai-voice-agents/receptionist">AI receptionist plan</a> if you only need the phone answered.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-band-muted">Run a plumbing and heating business, or work across more trades? See our <a href="/ai-voice-agents/trades">AI receptionist for trades</a>, which covers electricians, roofers, carpenters and other trades.</p>
