  /ai-voice-agents/salons (October 2026): the /ai-voice-agents layout, section for section, with content written
  for hair, nail and beauty salons and medspas (lib/content/voice-salons/), from the brief "OMH AI Voice Agent for
  Salons & Beauty". Same layout as the other industry pages. Rendered by app/ai-voice-agents/[industry]/page.tsx.
  The brief leaves out the sample-call recordings section and has no use-cases section; "Salons we cover" takes
  their place.
